# Writing Markdown

## What is Markdown and what is Mkdocs?
Markdown is a simplistic markup language that is used to write documentations with a file that ends with `.md`. The greatest thing about markdown is its simplicity, this allows it to be rendered in many formats - `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.tex`, and with the case of Mkdocs, to render websites. Mkdocs is simply a renderer for markdown that generates files essential for websites (HTML, CSS, JS). These files allows the possiblity of deploying markdown documents into your own websites (in servers or external providers such as github pages).

There are a lot of places to learn how to write markdown, and due to its simplistic design, it is relatively easy to learn. Below the summary of a [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax) made by Github
